EMF-REST
========

EMF-REST is a tool that allow the generation of Truly RESTFul APIs from Ecore models. It allows web developers to generate JSON-based Web APIs for their applications. EMF-REST complements the existing API generation facilities that EMF already provides, but that are limited to java and extends it to be used in web applications.

EMF-REST has been developed as an Eclipse plugin, whose features currently implemented are:

* Generation of REST services in the server based on the Java JAX-RS specification.
* Generation of serializers for the JSON format.
* Generation of a JavaScript? API to work with models as Javascript Objects in the client-side.
* The tool is under heavy development but you can give it a try by using the update site file or downloading the source code from the GIT repository.
